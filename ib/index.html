	<h2>Benefits of taking IB courses<?h2>

<h3><ol>
<li>Better prepared for college. IB courses are at a higher level than the general courses in high schools. Many see IB courses as college-level. Therefore, if students are doing well and are able to keep up in their IB courses, the transition to college work should be smooth.</li>
<li>Critical thinking skills. IB strongly encourages students to think critically. This is not always the case for students in general classes. Critical thinking skills are important for everyone to have, and are much needed as a college student.</li>
<li>Impress the admissions committee. Even if the college does not offer college credit for IB courses, most admissions committees see IB as challenging. Most students who partake in IB courses choose to take the classes or the IB programme. Therefore, this is proof that students are pushing themselves academically. This is something that most admissions officers want to see students do in their high school career.</li>
<li>Help with major selection. IB courses dig much deeper than general courses. Therefore, IB students get to experience a lot more of a subject than they would in a general class. This can help students narrow down their list for the major they want to study in college.</li>
<li>Potentially prepared for AP test. If colleges do not offer college credit for IB courses, but do give credit for AP tests, IB students will probably be prepared to take the AP test.</li>
